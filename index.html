            <p class="text">Unlike other freight brokerage schools or courses, Freight Dojo Bootcamp incorporates detailed systems instruction along with hands-on/ live training by seasoned freight agents who also work in the industry every day. In addition, we don't charge thousands of dollars for a weekend of PowerPoint presentations! Our disciplined hands-on Program is offered for the very reasonable fee, which we use to subsidize our costs for training materials and facilitator time. The training fee is NOT due up front. Rather, you pay the fee in small increments once you start earning commissions. If you quit the program early for any reason, you do not pay any fee difference not covered by your commissions earned to the termination date. </p>

        <h2 class="title">FAQ</h2>
        <ul class="faqList">
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>How much does your Program cost?</h4>
            <p>If you have done any research on other freight broker programs, you know that many of them charge anywhere from $500 to $5000 for a course that lasts from two to five days. These courses also only provide a series of PowerPoint presentations or videos downloaded onto a single CD covering the bare minimum basics of freight brokering. Because we are as invested in the success of our Program participants as they are in our program, the only charge for the full 90-day training opportunity is $599.00 which we use to subsidize our costs for training materials and facilitator time. The $599 training fee cost will be deducted from your commission payments in small percentage increments until paid in full. If you leave the program early for some reason, you do not pay any difference owed.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>Do you offer online training or training <br/> outside of the Los Angeles area?</h4>
            <p>If there is one thing we have learned during the development of our Program, it is that new freight agents have a much higher chance of sustained success when they are given the opportunity to shadow seasoned agents and experience real life, day-to-day freight brokerage scenarios. For this reason, we do not currently offer online or remote participation in the Program. All Program Training occurs in-person at our facility in beautiful downtown Burbank.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>How long is the Program?</h4>
            <p>Because we truly believe that the best way to learn freight brokerage the right way is to experience and engage in as many real life brokerage scenarios, the training Program is designed to take 90 days. However, we also recognize that people learn and become confident in freight brokerage skills at different paces. Therefore, we review each participant every 30 days to ensure the correct development path is being utilized and provide a unique one-on-one approach to success.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>How frequently is the Program offered?</h4>
            <p>We currently offer the Program four times per year, generally near the beginning of each calendar year quarter. Because the Program is in such high demand and we keep each course small so that all participants get the training, guidance and attention they need on an individual level, we are selective about who we accept. We also try to ensure that participants in each Program module have similar levels of industry or sales experience in order to maximize the rate of success for all participants in the module. Program start dates are posted 30 to 60 days before the module is scheduled to begin and can be found under the Training tab.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>Do I need to have my own book of business <br/> to be accepted into the Program?</h4>
            <p>While having a book of business when a participant begins the Program is always welcome and may lead to commission generation in an accelerated time frame, we do not require a book of business for acceptance. During the Program, participants are given access to hundreds of live, hot leads generated through our ownership of the 1-800-Landstar telephone number and other reliable and consistent resources.</p>

            <h4>Do I earn anything during the Program?</h4>
            <p>It is the goal of the Program facilitators to train and assist each participant in a manner that results in commission earnings as soon as possible. During the Program, participants can begin earning commissions on all business they generate – the amount and the potential to earn commissions during the Program is tied directly to the participant’s own drive and commitment to his or her own success.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>So, how long does it take for me to start <br/>earning money?</h4>
            <p>Although it is one of the goals of our Program facilitators to help participants begin to book freight by the beginning of week two, the answer to this question really depends, in large part, on the drive and commitment of each individual participant. Because participants should be entering the Program with the mindset that they are learning a new skill, we recommend that each participant be in a financial position which allows him or her to commit to the Program without having to worry about covering basic living necessities.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>Once I do begin earning commissions, <br/> how frequently are they paid out?</h4>
            <p>Commission are only earned after the Program participant provides all of his or her required paperwork to our Corporate partner’s support team, the team receives the bill of lading from the carrier and the customer is invoiced. Assuming all of these requirements have been met, commissions are settled and paid out every other Friday.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faqItem">
            <h4>What does an average agent, who has <br/> participated in your Program, make?</h4>
            <p>Again, the earning potential of each agent is primarily determined by his or her personal drive and commitment. Because you are your own boss, you decide how many hours or days you want to devote to your new business career. We currently have agents whose earnings range from $24,000 to $150,000 per year. That said, our average agent earns between $40,000 and $60,000 in commissions per year.</p>
